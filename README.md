##Textify: An OCR File Extractor ✨##
Textify is a robust Optical Character Recognition (OCR) file extractor that efficiently converts images into editable text using Python and the Tesseract-OCR engine. This tool is designed for developers and users who need to digitize printed documents, enabling seamless text extraction from various image formats. 📄➡️🖊️

To run Textify, you need Python 3.x installed on your system and Tesseract-OCR for OCR functionality. Installation instructions for Tesseract can be found here.

**Installation** ⚙️
1.Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/textify.git cd textify

2. Install Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Install Tesseract-OCR:

  Windows: Download the installer from Tesseract at UB Mannheim and follow the installation instructions.
  macOS: Install using Homebrew: brew install tesseract
  Linux: Install using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

4. Configure Tesseract Path: Update the path to the Tesseract executable in ocr_extractor.py if it is not automatically detected. For example, on Windows, you might set it as follows: pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'

**Usage 🚀**
To extract text from images, follow these steps:

Place your image files in the images directory.
Run the OCR extraction script: python ocr_extractor.py
The extracted text will be displayed in the console output. 🖥️
